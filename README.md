# ⚠️ Requirements ⚠️
* Before starting, you should install :

  - *[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)*
  - *[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)*
  - *[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)*
  - *[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)*
  - *[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)*

# 🏰 Create infrastructure 🏰
* Perform the following steps :
```
  cd infrastructure/
```
```
  terragrunt run-all plan
```
```
  terragrunt run-all apply
```
  *I can't but mention that infrastructure creation takes at least 70 minutes.*
  
# 🧊 Update kubeconfig 🧊
* After infrastructure provisioning run :
```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name education-eks
```

# 🧱 Prepare your EKS cluster 🧱
* Install the following :

  - *[AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html#lbc-install-controller)*
  - *[Amazon EFS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html)*
  - *[Secrets Store CSI Secret driver and AWS Secrets and Configuration Provider (ASCP)](https://www.eksworkshop.com/beginner/194_secrets_manager/configure-csi-driver/)*

# ㊙️ Create Secrets Manager secret ㊙️
* Create *one* Secrets Manager secret :

  * for `Secret type` choose `Other type of secret`;
  * create 3 `Key/value pairs` with the following keys : `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`, `CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN`, `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN`. Fill in the values yourself 😉

# 📑 Prepare needed IAM Roles 📑
  1) Create IAM Policy with access to your Secrets Manager secret (replace `YOUR_SECRET_ARN` with your Secrets Manager secret ARN) :
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
            ],
            "Resource": "YOUR_SECRET_ARN"
        }
    ]
}
```

  2) Create IAM Role for access with our ServiceAccount to the Secrets Manager :
  
     * for `Identity provider` choose one available `OpenID Connect` which was automatically created during infrastructure building;
     * for `Audience` choose `sts.amazonaws.com`;
     * for `Permission policies` choose our policy from the first step;
     * create your role. After this edit it `Trust Relatoinship` like below (replace `YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_ID` with appropriative values) :
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_ID"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_ID:sub": "system:serviceaccount:application:app"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

  3) Move to `ansible/Node_App_Chart/values.yaml` and change `ServiceAccount.roleARN` value with Role ARN from the previous step;

  4) Create IAM Role for future work with OpenSearch Service :
  
     * choose `Trusted entity type` - `AWS service`, `Use case` - `Lambda`;
     * for `Permission policies` choose AWS managed `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` & `AmazonOpenSearchServiceFullAccess`.
  
# 🐳 Prepare Docker image 🐳
* Before starting, you should move `ansible/` directory to the `$HOME` destination. It's necessary! The next steps :

```
cd ~/ansible/
```
```
ansible-playbook build-push-to-ecr.yml
```

After these steps, navigate to your AWS ECR repository and copy just pushed Image URI. Then move to `ansible/Node_App_Chart/values.yaml` and change the `container.image` value by just copied. This only needs to be done once. Afterward, another Ansible role will be responsible for this.
  
# 🚀 Deploy your application 🚀
* Perform the following steps :
```
cd ~/ansible/
```
```
ansible-playbook deploy_application.yaml
```
```
for the release name enter *application* (without asterisks)
```

Now you can check results using `helm list` command!

# 5️⃣3️⃣ Create a record for your ALB endpoint 5️⃣3️⃣
* Perform the following :

  * uncomment `infrastructure/route53_record/terragrunt.hcl` file;
  * run `kubectl get ingress -n application`. Copy value of the `ADDRESS` field;
  * navigate to `infrastructure/common_vars.hcl` and change `elb_dns_name` value by just copied;
```
      cd infrastructure/
```
```
      terragrunt run-all plan
```
```
      terragrunt run-all apply
```

# 🛠️ How to update infrastructure? 🛠️
* For example, the application folder got new changes. It's time to build a new Docker image : 
```
cd ~/ansible/
```
```
ansible-playbook build-push-to-ecr.yml
```
  OK, the image is successfully pushed to ECR. What's next? It's time to update K8s :
```
cd ~/ansible/
```
```
ansible-playbook upgrade_release.yaml
```
```
for the release name enter *application* (without asterisks)
```

# 🗺️ OpenSearch Service 🗺️
* Navigate to OpenSearch Service in the  AWS Management Console : 

  * Click on `its-application` cluster -> open `OpenSearch Dashboards URL`;
  * Log in with credentials provided at `infrastructure/opensearch/terragrunt.hcl` file;
  * `Explore on my own` -> `Select your tenant` - `Global` -> `Confirm`;
  * click on the three vertical lines in the left upper corner -> `Security` -> `Roles` -> `all_access` -> `Mapped users`;
  * click on `Manage mapping` button -> for `Backend roles` put IAM Role ARN created in the `Prepare needed IAM Roles` block step №4 -> `Map`.

* We also need to enable CloudWatch Logs streaming to the OpenSeacrh Service. Move to CloudWatch -> Log groups. Then :

  * select `/aws/eks/education-eks/cluster` Log group;
  * click `Actions` -> `Subscription filters` -> `Create Amazon OpenSearch Service subscription filter`; you'll be forwarded on a new page;
  * `Select account` - `This account`, `Amazon Opensearch Service Cluser` - choose one available `its-application`, `Lambda IAM Execution Role` select created in the `Prepare needed IAM Roles` block step №4;
  * `Log format` - `Json`, `Subscription filter pattern` - `" "`, `Subscription filter name` enter what you wish. Scroll down and click `Start Streaming`.

* The last step is to create `Index pattern` in OpenSearch Service :
  * open `OpenSearch Dashboards URL` main page;
  * click on the three vertical lines in the left upper corner -> `Discover` -> `Index patterns` -> `Create index pattern`;
  * put `*` for `Index pattern name` (below that field, you'll see matched index with your logs named `cwl-`) -> click `Next step`;
  * choose `@timestamp` for `Time field` -> `Create index pattern`;
  * click on the three vertical lines in the left upper corner -> `Discover` -> that's all. Now you are accessible to dive deep into the given data!
  
Have you made it this far? I have the utmost respect for you 👏</br>
